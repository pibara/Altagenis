        <p>I'm not a novelist, in fact, although I love reading fantasy and Sci-fi  and had been
creating wild stories in my head for decades, I never had the urge to write any of them down.
During my winter season stay in west Africa I got inspired by several aspects of life in west Africa. The west African winter temperatures that even at night never dropped below 80°F (in the Netherlands,
even summer days that peek above 80°F are pretty scarce). The lively religious life with a significant role for angels. By the Benin Voudoun festival and by the always buzy tiny ants that kept investing our families apartment.
<br>
Lacking any of the tools of my trade,  not creating any of the rather technical products I usually spent my days creating, a first seed started growing.
<br>
The Orus-2 seasonal migrations started to solidify in my head. Armed with just the primitive editor on the old smart-phone I had on me,  I started to commit Orus-2 to an ASCII file on my phone.Than,  thoughts of my late father entered the picture. My dad was a convinced atheist. Weird Sci-fi like hypothesis's that had been tied to many of my teenage discussions my dad fell into place and this small Sci-fi saga found its form.
<br>
My writings are most likely crude. Most writing I've done have been tech papers and articles,   but I do feel the saga's outline and the Orus system are a solid foundation of what could be an amazing Sci-Fi novel.
<br>
Given that due to my limited fiction writing skills this work does not do justice to the story-line, I decided to try and make cooperative creation of a final work based on this story-line a serious option. Lacking any handles to do so without funding coworker from my rather thin wallet, an idea started to solidify that was much bigger than this story-line. The idea of a colored BitCoin based copyright licence.
<br>
This work is now the first submission to BitNym, aimed to be used as an example of usage of the Creative Bitclaim copyright license.
<br>
I hope you will enjoy reading this tale as much as I enjoyed writing it. If you did and would like to contribute to making it a great novel, or if you yourself have sagas worth growing cooperatively, or are interested in contributing to the community effort to  develop the 1 version of the Creative BitClaim copyright licence, please join me on <a href="http://pibara.github.io/bitnym/">The BytNym site</a></p>
